Canadian Ham Radio Quiz

This project started because the standard tools for studying for the
Industry Canada exam are windows based, and *nix users are out of luck
if they want to get their qualification.

To run the program, you must have Python (tested with 2.6.1 which is
default on Mac Snow Leopard), and simply type:

  ./chrq.py

I'm trying to make the quiz bilingual, so don't hesitate to let me
know if my French needs correction.
