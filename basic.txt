B-002-3-3 (4) What is simplex operation?
1. Transmitting and receiving over a wide area
2. Transmitting on one frequency and receiving on another
3. Transmitting one-way communications
4. Transmitting and receiving on the same frequency
> 'Simplex' ( also known as direct ) operation where two stations use one frequency in turns contrasts with repeater operation (duplex) where two frequencies are used simultaneously ( the repeater output frequency and the repeater input frequency ).  Stations should avoid tying-up a repeater for long periods of time when within range of one another on a simplex frequency.  Most receivers can be switched to the repeater input frequency at the press of a button (this is useful to verify if simplex operation is possible with a given station).

B-002-3-4 (1) When should you use simplex operation instead of a repeater?
1. When a contact is possible without using a repeater
2. When the most reliable communications are needed
3. When an emergency telephone call is needed
4. When you are traveling and need some local information
> 'Simplex' ( also known as direct ) operation where two stations use one frequency in turns contrasts with repeater operation (duplex) where two frequencies are used simultaneously ( the repeater output frequency and the repeater input frequency ).  Stations should avoid tying-up a repeater for long periods of time when within range of one another on a simplex frequency.  Most receivers can be switched to the repeater input frequency at the press of a button (this is useful to verify if simplex operation is possible with a given station).

B-002-3-5 (1) Why should local amateur communications use VHF and UHF frequencies instead of HF frequencies?
1. To minimize interference on HF bands capable of long-distance communication
2. Because greater output power is permitted on VHF and UHF
3. Because HF transmissions are not propagated locally
4. Because signals are louder on VHF and UHF frequencies
> Always choose a frequency with the least reach so the spectrum remains usable elsewhere.

B-002-3-6 (3) Why should simplex be used where possible, instead of using a repeater?

2. The repeater's output power may ruin your station's receiver
3. There are more repeater operators than simplex operators
4. Changing the repeater's frequency requires the authorization of Industry Canada
> If you operate simplex on a repeater frequency, you are preventing others from using the repeater.  Amateur organizations publish 'Band Plans' where segments reserved for simplex operation are recommended.

B-002-4-6 (1) If you are the net control station of a daily HF net, what should you do if the frequency on which you normally meet is in use just before the net begins?
1. Conduct the net on a frequency 3 to 5 kHz away from the regular net frequency
2. Reduce your output power and start the net as usual
3. Increase your power output so that net participants will be able to hear you over the existing activity
4. Cancel the net for that day
> A 'Net' is an activity carried on a given day and time at a known frequency where stations exchange information.  Although no given station is entitled to any specific frequency (regardless of license class, power or affiliation), stations would normally yield to an established daily net but if not, you need to move the net away.

B-002-4-7 (1) If a net is about to begin on a frequency which you and another station are using, what should you do? 
1. As a courtesy to the net, move to a different frequency
2. Increase your power output to ensure that all net participants can hear you
3. Transmit as long as possible on the frequency so that no other stations may use it
4. Turn off your radio
> A 'Net' is an activity carried on a given day and time at a known frequency where stations exchange information.  Although no given station is entitled to any specific frequency (regardless of license class, power or affiliation), stations would normally yield to an established daily net but if not, you need to move the net away.

1. To keep anyone opening the cabinet from getting shocked by dangerous high voltages
2. To keep dangerous RF radiation from leaking out through an open cabinet
3. To keep dangerous RF radiation from coming in through an open cabinet
4. To turn the power supply off when it is not being used

B-003-18-10 (1) Before checking a fault in a mains operated power supply unit, it would be safest to FIRST:
1. turn off the power and remove power plug
2. short out leads of filter capacitor
3. check action of capacitor bleeder resistance
4. remove and check fuse from power supply
> key words: "MAINS" OPERATED.  This refers to 'Household' current which runs at 120 Volts and can supply hundreds of Amperes (for a brief time) before a fuse or breaker interrupts the circuit after a fault.  30 VOLTS is considered potentially dangerous to humans and less than A TENTH of an AMPERE can lead to cardiac arrest.

B-003-18-11 (1) Fault finding in a power supply of an amateur transmitter while the supply is operating is not a recommended technique because of the risk of:
1. electric shock
2. damaging the transmitter
3. overmodulation
4. blowing the fuse
> This was especially true of transmitters using vacuum tubes.  Plate voltages ran into the hundreds of Volts with current capacities of hundreds of milliamperes.  30 VOLTS is considered potentially dangerous to humans and less than A TENTH of an AMPERE can lead to cardiac arrest.  

B-003-19-1 (2) For best protection from electrical shock, what should be grounded in an amateur station?
1. The antenna feed line
2. All station equipment
3. The AC power line
4. The power supply primary
> An external ground connection on each cabinet serves as a backup to the normal electrical outlet ground ( the 'green' wire in a three-lead power cord ).

B-003-19-2 (1) If a separate ground system is not possible for your amateur station, an alternative indoor grounding point could be:
1. a metallic cold water pipe
2. a plastic cold water pipe
3. a window screen
4. a metallic natural gas pipe
> A 'metallic cold water pipe' normally offers the most direct solid conduction to earth ground.

B-003-19-3 (1) To protect you against electrical shock, the chassis of each piece of your station equipment should be connected to:
1. a good ground connection
2. a dummy load
3. insulated shock mounts
4. the antenna

1. To the white wire
2. To the "hot" side of the power switch
3. To the chassis
4. To the fuse
> The 'green wire' in a three-wire AC line cord is a ground connection.  Securing the 'green wire' to the chassis (and outside cabinet) keeps the chassis at ground potential if a fault ever caused the 'live' side (120 Volts) of the AC line to contact the chassis.

B-003-19-7 (3) If your third-floor amateur station has a ground wire running 10.05 metres (33 feet) down to a ground rod, why might you get an RF burn if you touch the front panel of your HF transceiver?
1. Because of a bad antenna connection, allowing the RF energy to take an easier path out of the transceiver through you
2. Because the transceiver's heat-sensing circuit is not working to start the cooling fan
3. Because the ground wire is a resonant length on several HF bands and acts more like an antenna than an RF ground connection
4. Because the ground rod is not making good contact with moist earth
> key word:  10 METRES.  RF 'hot spots' and RF 'burns' are symptoms of 'Stray RF'.  This is relatively long in comparison with some of the wavelengths in the HF (High Frequency) spectrum.  For example, 10 metres is a quarter wavelength on the 40-metre band.  A wire this long looks like an antenna and will not provide a low impedance ground connection necessary to evacuate 'Stray RF'.

B-003-19-8 (3) What is one good way to avoid stray RF energy in your amateur station?

4. The chassis of each piece of station equipment should be tied together with high-impedance conductors
> RF 'hot spots' and RF 'burns' are symptoms of 'Stray RF'.  To eliminate 'Stray RF', a low impedance path to ground must be provided.  Only SHORT and WIDE ground conductors can provide low impedance.

B-003-19-10 (4) On mains operated power supplies, the ground wire should be connected to the metal chassis of the power supply. This ensures, in case there is a fault in the power supply, that the chassis:
1. does not become conductive to prevent electric shock
2. becomes conductive to prevent electric shock
3. develops a high voltage compared to the ground
4. does not develop a high voltage with respect to the ground
> The 'green wire' in a three-wire AC line cord is a ground connection.  Securing the 'green wire' to the chassis (and outside cabinet) keeps the chassis at ground potential if a fault ever caused the 'live' side (120 Volts) of the AC line to contact the chassis.

B-003-19-11 (2) The purpose of using a three-wire power cord and plug on amateur radio equipment is to:
1. prevent the plug from being reversed in the wall outlet
2. prevent the chassis from becoming live in case of an internal short to the chassis
3. prevent short circuits
4. make it inconvenient to use
> The 'green wire' in a three-wire AC line cord is a ground connection.  Securing the 'green wire' to the chassis (and outside cabinet) keeps the chassis at ground potential if a fault ever caused the 'live' side (120 Volts) of the AC line to contact the chassis.

1. Above high-voltage electrical lines
2. Just high enough so you can easily reach it for adjustments or repairs
3. High enough so that no one can touch any part of it from the ground
4. As close to the ground as possible
> Even at modest power, touching a radiating antenna or open-wire line can lead to 'RF burns'.  Voltage is not the only factor, radio-frequency reaches deep into the skin, potentially causing nasty burns.  "1" would be a dangerous mistake:  if the antenna dropped, lethal voltages would be carried back to the station.  "4" is not what we usually want to do with our antennas.

B-003-20-7 (4) Why should you wear a hard hat if you are on the ground helping someone work on an antenna tower?
1. So you won't be hurt if the tower should accidentally fall
2. To keep RF energy away from your head during antenna testing
3. So someone passing by will know that work is being done on the tower and will stay away
4. To protect your head from something dropped from the tower
> Think for a second about a screwdriver, wrench or a heavy bolt falling on your head from a height of 14 metres (48 feet).

B-003-20-8 (3) Why should your outside antennas be high enough so that no one can touch them while you are transmitting?

> Even at modest power, touching a radiating antenna or open-wire line can lead to 'RF burns'.  Voltage is not the only factor, radio-frequency reaches deep into the skin, potentially causing nasty burns.

B-003-20-9 (2) Why should you make sure that no one can touch an open-wire feed line while you are transmitting with it?
1. Because contact might break the feed line
2. Because high-voltage radio energy might burn the person
3. Because contact might cause spurious emissions
4. Because contact might cause a short circuit and damage the transmitter
> Even at modest power, touching a radiating antenna or open-wire line can lead to 'RF burns'.  Voltage is not the only factor, radio-frequency reaches deep into the skin, potentially causing nasty burns.

B-003-20-10 (1) What safety precautions should you take before beginning repairs on an antenna?
1. Be sure to turn off the transmitter and disconnect the feed line
2. Be sure you and the antenna structure are grounded
3. Inform your neighbours so they are aware of your intentions
4. Turn off the main power switch in your house
> "Disconnecting the transmission line", that is an important precaution to ensure that no RF is ever sent to the antenna.  This is especially important if there are several parties in the work crew:  an operator could return to the station, turn-on a transmitter and put someone outside at risk.

B-003-20-11 (3) What precaution should you take when installing a ground-mounted antenna?
1. It should be painted so people or animals do not accidentally run into it
2. It should not be installed in a wet area
3. It should be installed so no one can come in contact with it

Disconnect transmission lines before working on antennas (to further reduce the odds of an error at the station exposing to RF).

B-003-21-2 (2) What should you do for safety if you put up a UHF transmitting antenna?

4. Make sure all RF screens are in place at the antenna feed line
> RF energy can heat body tissue.  VHF and UHF frequencies present the greatest risk.

B-003-21-4 (2) Why should you make sure the antenna of a hand-held transceiver is not close to your head when transmitting?
1. To use your body to reflect the signal in one direction
2. To reduce your exposure to the radio-frequency energy
3. To keep static charges from building up
4. To help the antenna radiate energy equally in all directions

B-003-21-9 (3) If you operate your amateur station with indoor antennas, what precautions should you take when you install them?
1. Position the antennas parallel to electrical power wires to take advantage of parasitic effects
2. Position the antennas along the edge of a wall where it meets the floor or ceiling to reduce parasitic radiation
3. Locate the antennas as far away as possible from living spaces that will be occupied while you are operating
4. Locate the antennas close to your operating position to minimize feed-line length
> RF energy can heat body tissue.  Keep the antennas away from people and use as little power as possible.

B-003-21-10 (1) Why should directional high-gain antennas be mounted higher than nearby structures?

4. So they will receive more sky waves and fewer ground waves
> RF energy can heat body tissue.  VHF and UHF frequencies present the greatest risk.  Never point antennas at anyone.  Never look into antennas.  Disconnect transmission lines before working on antennas (to further reduce the odds of an error at the station exposing to RF).

B-003-21-11 (1) For best RF safety, where should the ends and center of a dipole antenna be located?
1. As high as possible to prevent people from coming in contact with the antenna

B-003-17-2 (2) What device converts household current to 12 VDC?
1. A low pass filter
2. A power supply
3. An RS-232 interface
4. A catalytic converter
> A large percentage of modern transceivers are designed to work off 12 Volts DC which is readily available from a car battery.  To use a rig in the home, a 'Power Supply' is required:  a 'Power Supply' combines a transformer, rectifier and filter to convert 120 Volts AC down to 12 Volts DC.

B-003-17-3 (3) Which of these usually needs a heavy-duty power supply?
1. An antenna switch
2. A receiver
3. A transceiver
4. An SWR meter
> key words:  HEAVY-DUTY.  Receivers rarely draw more than 1 Ampere at 12 VDC.  A 100-Watt transceiver (while on transmit) can draw 20 Amperes at 12 VDC.

B-003-17-4 (1) What may cause a buzzing or hum in the signal of an AC-powered transmitter?
1. A bad filter capacitor in the transmitter's power supply
2. Using an antenna which is the wrong length
3. Energy from another transmitter
4. Bad design of the transmitter's RF power output circuit
> key word:  HUM.  Remember the 'Power Supply' block diagram:  a 'Rectifier' (diode) converts AC into 'pulsating DC'.  A 'Filter' then smoothes out the 'pulsating DC' into pure DC.  If the 'Filter' is deficient, hum or buzzing will appear on the transmitted signal.

B-003-17-5 (4) A power supply is to supply DC at 12 volts at 5 amperes. The power transformer should be rated higher than:
1. 17 watts
2. 2.4 watts
3. 6 watts
4. 60 watts
> Power, expressed in Watts = Voltage, in Volts, TIMES Current, in Amperes.  P = E * I.  Watts = Volts * Amperes.

B-003-17-6 (2) The diode is an important part of a simple power supply. It converts AC to DC, since it:
1. has a high resistance to AC but not to DC
2. allows electrons to flow in only one direction from cathode to anode
3. has a high resistance to DC but not to AC
4. allows electrons to flow in only one direction from anode to cathode
> A DIODE, vacuum tube or semiconductor, has two electrodes:  Anode and Cathode.  Electrons flow from Cathode to Anode in a forward-biased (i.e., a diode subjected to a voltage polarity which permits conduction) diode.

B-003-17-7 (3) To convert AC to pulsating DC, you could use a:
1. transformer
2. capacitor
3. diode
4. resistor

1. 120 and 240 volts
2. 110 and 220 volts
3. 100 and 200 volts
4. 130 and 260 volts
> Nominal household voltages have slowly come up since the early 20th century from 110V, to 115V, to 117V, to 120V.  The current standard is 120V and 240V.  240V is used for energy-hungry devices like water heaters, clothes dryers, electric ovens AND high-power linear amplifiers.

B-003-17-9 (4) So-called "transformerless" power supplies are used in some applications (notably tube-type radios and TV receivers). When working on such equipment, one should be very careful because:
1. DC circuits are negative relative to the chassis
2. chassis connections are grounded by the centre pin of the power source's plug
3. the load across the power supply is variable
4. one side of the line cord is connected to the chassis
> 120V AC household current is delivered over two wires:  one 'neutral' at ground potential and a 'live' wire at 120 V AC above ground potential.  If a fault occurs and YOU become part of the return path from a 'live' wire to ground, you could be electrocuted.

B-003-17-10 (2) If household voltages are consistently high or low at your location, this can be corrected by the use of:
1. a full-wave bridge rectifier
2. an autotransformer
3. a variable voltmeter
4. a proper load resistance
> An 'autotransformer':  a transformer where primary and secondary are simply taps on a common winding.  An autotransformer can efficiently provide small adjustments to voltage.  A 'Rectifier' converts AC to 'pulsating DC'.  A 'Voltmeter' measures voltage.  A 'Resistance' opposes current flow.

B-003-17-11 (1) You have a very loud low-frequency hum appearing on your transmission. In what part of the transmitter would you first look for the trouble?
1. the power supply
2. the variable-frequency oscillator
3. the driver circuit
4. the power amplifier circuit
> key word:  HUM.  Remember the 'Power Supply' block diagram:  a 'Rectifier' (diode) converts AC into 'pulsating DC'.  A 'Filter' then smoothes out the 'pulsating DC' into pure DC.  If the 'Filter' is deficient, hum or buzzing will appear on the transmitted signal.

1. 7.435 MHz
2. 3.995 MHz
3. 455 kHz
4. 3.54 MHz
> The mixer accepts two inputs:  the incoming signal and the local High Frequency Oscillator.  Mixing returns two new products:  the sum of the two inputs, the difference of the two inputs.  The IF Filter seeks to let only one of the products into the Intermediate Frequency chain for amplification through the IF Amplifier.  In this example, 3995 kHz minus 3540 kHz yields 455 kHz.

1. A notch filter
2. A band pass filter
3. An all pass filter
4. A pi-network filter
> The problem presented here is an offending signal within the receiver passband (the range of frequencies allowed though the Intermediate Frequency chain).  A 'Notch Filter' which attenuates a very narrow range of frequencies can be used to remove the interfering carrier.

B-003-10-8 (4) The three main parameters against which the quality of a receiver is measured are:
1. selectivity, stability and frequency range
2. sensitivity, stability and cross-modulation
3. sensitivity, selectivity and image rejection
4. sensitivity, selectivity and stability
> Three times letter S:  Sensitivity, Selectivity and Stability.  Sensitivity:  render weak signals with less noise.  Selectivity: the ability to separate signals from adjacent ones.  Stability:  staying on frequency over time despite temperature or voltage variations.

B-003-10-9 (2) A communications receiver has four filters installed in it, one at 250 Hz, one at 500 Hz, one at 2.4 kHz, and one at 6 kHz. If you were listening to single sideband, which filter would you utilize?
1. 250 Hz
2. 2.4 kHz
3. 6 kHz
4. 500 Hz
> In order of bandwidth requirements:  CW = about 100 Hz, RTTY = about 600 Hz, SSB = 2 to 3 kHz, FM = 10 to 20 kHz.  A 2.4 kHz filter is just wide enough to accept an SSB signal.  Wider a filter, lets in more noise.  Too narrow a filter causes distortion.

B-003-10-10 (4) A communications receiver has four filters installed in it, one at 250 Hz, one at 500 Hz, one at 2.4 kHz and one at 6 kHz. You are copying a CW transmission and there is a great deal of interference. Which one of the filters would you choose?
1. 500 Hz
2. 2.4 kHz
3. 6 kHz
4. 250 Hz
> In order of bandwidth requirements:  CW = about 100 Hz, RTTY = about 600 Hz, SSB = 2 to 3 kHz, FM = 10 to 20 kHz.  A 250 Hz filter is best to isolate a CW signal.  Wider a filter, lets in more noise.  Too narrow a filter causes distortion.

B-003-10-11 (3) Selectivity can be placed in the audio stages of a receiver by the utilization of RC active or passive audio filters. If you were to copy CW, which of the following bandpasses would you choose?
1.  2100 - 2300 Hz
2.  300 - 2700 Hz
3.  750 - 850 Hz
4.  100 - 1100 Hz
> key words:  AUDIO STAGES.  After the 'Product Detector', an incoming CW signal is now an audible tone.  Most receivers render CW as a note somewhere in the range of 750 Hz to 850 Hz.  Additional band-pass filtering (allowing only a certain range of frequencies) can be useful to knock down adjacent stations finding their way into the receiver passband (the range of frequencies allowed though the Intermediate Frequency chain) and producing higher or lower notes, say at 250 or 1000 Hz.

B-003-13-11 (4) FM receivers perform in an unusual manner when two or more stations are present. The loudest signal, even though it is only two or three times as loud as the other signals, will be the only transmission demodulated. This is called:
1. attach effect
2. interference effect
3. surrender effect
4. capture effect
> The 'Capture Effect' is specific to FM receivers:  only the stronger of two signals at or near the same frequency will be demodulated.  The complete suppression of the weaker signal occurs at the receiver limiter.  When both signals are nearly equal in strength, or are fading independently, the receiver may switch from one to the other.  http://en.wikipedia.org/

2. A small change in a transmitter's frequency each time it is keyed
3. A slow change in transmitter frequency as the circuit warms up
4. An overload in a receiver's audio circuit whenever CW is received
> "Chirp":  Inadequate voltage regulation causes the Master Oscillator frequency to shift when the Telegraph Key is pressed.  Perceived at the receive location as a change of pitch during each Morse element.  "3" is frequency 'drift', a lack of stability in the Master Oscillator.

2. Keep the power supply voltages very steady
3. Keep the power supply current very steady
4. Add a low pass filter
> "Chirp":  Inadequate voltage regulation causes the Master Oscillator frequency to shift when the Telegraph Key is pressed.  Perceived at the receive location as a change of pitch during each Morse element.  "3" Current varies as demand varies in a transmitter.  "4" Low-Pass filter reduces 'harmonics'.

B-003-11-6 (3) Morse code is usually transmitted by radio as:
1. a series of key-clicks
2. a continuous carrier
3. an interrupted carrier
4. a voice-modulated carrier
> Telegraphy is equivalent to 'on-off keying' (an 'interrupted carrier').  The Telegraph Key allows the operator to send bursts of RF energy to the antenna per the rhythm of his hand movement on the key.  "1" Key-Clicks is a type of interference where a CW signal generates unwanted sidebands.

B-003-11-7 (3) A mismatched antenna or feedline may present an incorrect load to the transmitter. The result may be:
1. loss of modulation in the transmitted signal
2. the driver stage will not deliver power to the final
3. excessive heat produced in the final transmitter stage
4. the output tank circuit breaks down
> The 'Final' = the Power Amplifier.  A serious impedance mismatch in the antenna system forces the Power Amplifier to operate in a load for which it was not designed. A significant mismatch causes high SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) which lead to voltage and current peaks which could damage the Power Amplifier.

B-003-11-8 (3) One result of a slight mismatch between the power amplifier of a transmitter and the antenna would be:
1. smaller DC current drain
2. lower modulation percentage
3. reduced antenna radiation
4. radiated key-clicks
> Impedance Match:  maximum power transfer occurs when the impedance of the load matches the internal impedance of the source.  A "slight mismatch" leads to reduced power being delivered to the antenna.

B-003-11-9 (3) An RF oscillator should be electrically and mechanically stable. This is to ensure that the oscillator does not:
1. become over modulated
2. generate key-clicks

2. It may cause atmospheric interference in the air around the antenna
3. It may cause splatter interference to other stations operating near its frequency
4. It may cause digital interference to computer equipment
> key words:  MICROPHONE GAIN SET TOO HIGH.  This leads to 'overmodulation' evidenced by distorted speech plus using excessive bandwidth on the air (splatter) which interferes with stations using adjacent frequencies ('out-of-channel emissions').

3. It may cause interference to other stations operating on a higher frequency band
4. It may cause splatter interference to other stations operating near its frequency
> key words:  TOO MUCH SPEECH PROCESSING.  'Speech processing' is raising the average amplitude of the audio input from the microphone closer to an acceptable peak value: i.e., make every passage of the spoken words equally loud.  Too much speech processing leads to distortion and possibly driving the Linear Power Amplifier with too large a signal (overdriving).  This leads to 'overmodulation' evidenced by distorted speech plus occupying excessive bandwidth on the air (splatter) which interferes with stations using adjacent frequencies ('out-of-channel emissions').

B-003-12-3 (2) What is the term for the average power supplied to an antenna transmission line during one RF cycle, at the crest of the modulation envelope?

1. 1 kHz
2. 2 kHz
3. Between 3 and 6 kHz
4. Between 2 and 3 kHz
> By transposing the voice signal into the radio spectrum, the SSB transmitter manages to only use the approximate bandwidth of the original modulation ( speech frequencies important to communications span 300 Hertz to 3000 Hertz, a bandwidth of 2700 Hertz ).  SSB uses half the bandwidth of AM.

3. RF amplifier
4. Carrier oscillator
> The Balanced Modulator produces a double-sideband suppressed-carrier signal.  The Filter keeps one sideband.  The SSB Transmitter block diagram:  The Balanced Modulator takes in two signals:  fixed frequency from an RF Oscillator and the microphone signal after it has passed through a Speech Amplifier.  Out of the Balanced Modulator, a Filter selects the desired sideband.  This SSB signal is mixed with a Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO) signal by a Mixer.  Out of the Mixer, the SSB signal is now at the operating frequency and is taken through a LINEAR Power Amplifier.

B-003-12-6 (1) What is one advantage of carrier suppression in a double-sideband phone transmission?
1. More power can be put into the sidebands
2. Only half the bandwidth is required for the same information content
3. Greater modulation percentage is obtainable with lower distortion
4. Simpler equipment can be used to receive a double-sideband suppressed-carrier signal
> Plain AM (Amplitude Modulation) produces a radio Carrier, an upper sideband and a lower sideband.  The sidebands are the ever-changing sum and differences of the modulating frequency (follows voice) and the carrier frequency (set at the operating frequency).  The carrier by itself does NOT convey information.  The message is in the sidebands.  Suppressing the carrier permits using the full capacity of the Power Amplifier for the sidebands.  Note:  Suppressing the carrier an one sideband yields Single Sideband.

B-003-12-7 (4) What happens to the signal of an overmodulated single-sideband or double-sideband phone transmitter?

3. For 100% frequency deviation on modulation peaks
4. For a dip in plate current
> ALC -- Automatic Level Control.  A feedback circuit from the Linear Power Amplifier to an earlier amplifier stage which seeks to avoid overdriving the transmitter with too much audio.  When the ALC acts, it is a corrective action.  An infrequent ALC action on modulation peaks indicates that there is no overdriving.  If the ALC needed to intervene constantly, this would indicate that the operator is trying to feed too much audio through the transmitter.

B-003-12-9 (4) The purpose of a balanced modulator in an SSB transmitter is to:
1. make sure that the carrier and both sidebands are 180 degrees out of phase
2. ensure that the percentage of modulation is kept constant
3. make sure that the carrier and both sidebands are in phase
4. suppress the carrier and pass on the two sidebands
> The Balanced Modulator produces a double-sideband suppressed-carrier signal.  The Filter keeps one sideband.  The SSB Transmitter block diagram:  The Balanced Modulator takes in two signals:  fixed frequency from an RF Oscillator and the microphone signal after it has passed through a Speech Amplifier.  Out of the Balanced Modulator, a Filter selects the desired sideband.  This SSB signal is mixed with a Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO) signal by a Mixer.  Out of the Mixer, the SSB signal is now at the operating frequency and is taken through a LINEAR Power Amplifier.

B-003-12-10 (2) In a SSB transmission, the carrier is:
1. transmitted with one sideband
2. reinserted at the receiver
3. inserted at the transmitter
4. of no use at the receiver
> In Amplitude Modulation, the position, along the radio spectrum, of a 'side frequency' within a sideband is the sum (or difference) of the modulating frequency and carrier frequency.  The statement is also true with Single Sideband (SSB) where the carrier has been suppressed:  the position of a 'side frequency' only has meaning in relation with the position of the phantom carrier.  Suitable demodulation at the receiving end supposes that the "carrier is re-inserted" so that each side frequency (a great number of which form a sideband) can be rendered as an exact audio frequency.

B-003-12-11 (2) The automatic level control (ALC) in a SSB transmitter :
1. eliminates the transmitter distortion
2. controls the peak audio input so that the final amplifier is not overdriven
3. increases the occupied bandwidth
4. reduces the system noise
> ALC -- Automatic Level Control.  A feedback circuit from the Linear Power Amplifier to an earlier amplifier stage which seeks to avoid overdriving the transmitter with too much audio.  When the ALC acts, it is a corrective action.  An infrequent ALC action on modulation peaks indicates that there is no overdriving.  If the ALC needed to intervene constantly, this would indicate that the operator is trying to feed too much audio through the transmitter.

1. Talk louder into the microphone
2. Let the transceiver cool off
3. Change to a higher power level
4. Talk farther away from the microphone
> key word:  OVERDEVIATION.    'Overdeviation (FM)' or 'Overmodulation (AM,SSB)' results in distorted speech plus using excessive bandwidth on the air (splatter) and interfering with stations using adjacent frequencies ('out-of-channel emissions').

B-003-13-4 (3) What kind of emission would your FM transmitter produce if its microphone failed to work?
1. A frequency-modulated carrier
2. An amplitude-modulated carrier
3. An unmodulated carrier
4. A phase-modulated carrier
>  The concept here is that IF NO AUDIO is fed in an FM transmitter, the carrier put out at the Power Amplifier has full amplitude anyway.  A carrier which conveys no message is an 'unmodulated carrier'.

B-003-13-5 (1) Why is FM voice best for local VHF/UHF radio communications?
1. It has high-fidelity audio which can be understood even when the signal is somewhat weak
2. The carrier is not detectable
3. It is more resistant to distortion caused by reflected signals
4. Its RF carrier stays on frequency better than the AM modes
> FM -- Frequency Modulation.  Long recognized for fidelity and absence of noise.  However, this comes at a the price of more transmitter bandwidth, 10 to 20 kilohertz in usual amateur communications.

B-003-13-8 (4)   What emission is produced by a reactance modulator connected to an RF power amplifier?
1. Multiplex modulation
2. Amplitude modulation
3. Pulse modulation
4. Phase modulation
> Direct FM: Use a variable reactance element as one of the elements of an oscillator to cause frequency deviation.  Indirect FM: apply the modulating voltage to a variable reactance element connected to a tuned circuit later in the transmit chain, where it will produce phase modulation rather than frequency modulation.

B-003-13-9 (4)   Why isn't frequency modulated (FM) phone used below 29.5 MHz?
1. The transmitter efficiency for this mode is low
2. Harmonics could not be attenuated to practical levels
3. The frequency stability would not be adequate
4. The bandwidth would exceed limits in the Regulations
> The usual bandwidth of FM on amateur bands is between 10 to 20 kilohertz.  This is much more than the allowed bandwidth on most HF bands per rules regulating the Amateur Radio service.

B-003-13-10 (1) You are transmitting FM on the 2 metre band. Several stations advise you that your transmission is distorted. A quick check with a frequency counter tells you that the transmitter is on the proper frequency. Which of the following is the most probable cause of the distortion?

> Two 10 ohm resistors in series present a total resistance of 20 ohms.  Use Ohm's Law ( I = E / R ) to compute current as 10 Volts divided by 20 ohms = 0.5 Amperes.  The Power Law:  P = E * I, Power is Voltage times Current.  Power for this example becomes 10 Volts times 0.5 Amperes = 5 Watts.

B-005-6-10 (3) One advantage of replacing a 50 ohm resistor with a parallel combination of two similarly rated 100 ohm resistors is that the parallel combination will have:
1. the same resistance but lesser power rating
2. greater resistance and similar power rating
3. the same resistance but greater power rating
4. lesser resistance and similar power rating
> This is about POWER RATING, not resistance.  Two identical resistors can safely dissipate TWICE as much power as only one.  Two resistors of 100 ohms in PARALLEL yield a total resistance of 50 ohms ( In a parallel circuit with IDENTICAL resistors, total resistance is value divided by number ).

B-005-11-1 (1) If no load is attached to the secondary winding of a transformer, what is current in the primary winding called?
1. Magnetizing current
2. Direct current
3. Excitation current
4. Stabilizing current
> Even if no current is drawn from the secondary of the transformer, the primary winding remains an inductor.  It lets some AC current through despite its reactance.  This minimal current is called "Magnetizing Current".

B-005-11-2 (1) A transformer operates a 6.3 volt 2 ampere light bulb from its secondary winding. The power consumed by the primary winding is approximately:
1. 13 watts
2. 6 watts
3. 8 watts
4. 3 watts
> The Power Law:  P = E * I, Power is Voltage times Current.  6.3 Volts * 2 Amperes = 12.6 Watts

B-005-11-3 (4) A transformer has a 240 volt primary that draws a current of 250 mA from the mains supply. Assuming no losses, what current would be available from a 12 volt secondary?
1. 215 amperes
2. 25 amperes
3. 50 amperes
4. 5 amperes
> As work is performed at a lower voltage on the secondary side, current on the secondary is larger.  The turns ratio is '20 to 1' ( 240 Volts to 12 Volts ), the current ratio follows the inverse of that ratio:  20 * 0.25 Amperes = 5 Amperes.  Method B:  Primary consumes 60 Watts  ( 240 Volts * 0.25 Amperes ),  secondary must draw that same power (discounting losses).  What is the secondary current for 60 Watts at 12 Volts ?  I = P / E (derived from P = E * I), I = 60 Watts / 12 Volts = 5 Amperes.

1. 440 V
2. 220 V
3. 560 V
4. 24 V
> A 'step-up' transformer, the secondary uses twice as many turns as the primary, voltage is doubled ( exactly per the turns ratio ).

B-005-11-5 (3) The strength of the magnetic field around a conductor in air is:
1. inversely proportional to the diameter of the conductor
2. directly proportional to the diameter of the conductor
3. directly proportional to the current in the conductor
4. inversely proportional to the voltage on the conductor
> Current and magnetism are closely related:  current in a conductor sets up a magnetic field, dropping a conductor through magnetic lines of force creates a current.  "1" and "2" allude to the conductor's diameter which has no influence.  "4" alludes to voltage which would only be of concern for an electrical field.

B-005-11-6 (1) Maximum induced voltage in a coil occurs when:
1. current is going through its greatest rate of change
2. the current through the coil is of a DC nature
3. current is going through its least rate of change
4. the magnetic field around the coil is not changing
> For induction to take place in a wire, a conductor must be subjected to a moving magnetic field (no movement, no induction).  Either the conductor must move in the magnetic field  OR  the magnetic field must move if the conductor is immobile.  If current changes drastically within a short period of time ('rate of change'), the magnetic field around the conductor changes rapidly, induction is maximized.

B-005-11-7 (3) The voltage induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic field is at a maximum when the movement is:
1. made in a counterclockwise direction
2. parallel to the lines of force
3. perpendicular to the lines of force
4. made in a clockwise direction
> For induction to be maximum, the conductor must "cut" through the lines of magnetic force. Dropping through perpendicularly (at 90 degrees) through the magnetic field maximizes induction.

B-005-11-8 (3)  A 100% efficient transformer has a turns ratio of 1/5. If the secondary current is 50 mA, the primary current is:
1. 2 500 mA
2. 0.01 A
3. 0.25 A
4. 0.25 mA
> A turns ratio of '1 to 5' indicates a 'step-up' transformer, primary current will be larger than the secondary current by the inverse of that ratio.  In this example, primary current is 5 * times 50 mA = 250 milliamperes = 0.25 Amperes.  Transformers do not "create" power out of nothing, the power ( E * I ) flowing into the primary equals the power drawn by the secondary plus losses (which are ignored for the sake of simplicity).  For power to remain "comparable" on both sides of the transformer, current goes up if voltage increases  and  vice-versa.

B-005-11-11 (3) The fact that energy transfer from primary to secondary windings in a power transformer is not perfect is indicated by:
1. electrostatic shielding
2. large secondary currents
3. warm iron laminations

1. It increases the radiation angle
2. It brings the feed point impedance closer to 300 ohms
3. It brings the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms
4. It lowers the radiation angle
> Radials are the three or four elements simulating ground at the base of an elevated vertical antenna (ground plane antenna).  Sloping radials (lower than 90 degrees) BRING up the impedance from about 30 ohms to 50 ohms for a better direct match to coaxial cable.

B-006-10-7 (1) What happens to the feed point impedance of a ground-plane antenna when its radials are changed from horizontal to downward-sloping?
1. It increases
2. It decreases
3. It stays the same
4. It approaches zero
> Radials are the three or four elements simulating ground at the base of an elevated vertical antenna (ground plane antenna).  Sloping radials (lower than 90 degrees) BRING up the impedance from about 30 ohms to 50 ohms for a better direct match to coaxial cable.

1. To tune out capacitive reactance
2. To lower the losses
3. To lower the Q
4. To improve reception
> Short answer: a coil (inductor) has a behaviour totally opposite to capacitors; 'cancelling reactive capacitance' makes sense.  A short antenna (e.g., 2.5m) operated on HF frequencies (wavelengths of 10 to 80 metres) looks like an antenna operated well below its natural resonant frequency.  If you think of an ideal antenna as a resonant circuit where capacitive and inductive reactances cancel each other, you'll note that CAPACITIVE reactance ( XC = 1 over '2 * PI * f * C' ) grows below the resonant frequency.  A "loading coil" cancels out that capacitive reactance.

B-006-10-11 (2) What is the main reason why so many VHF base and mobile antennas are 5/8 of a wavelength?
1. The angle of radiation is high giving excellent local coverage
2. The angle of radiation is low
3. It is easy to match the antenna to the transmitter
4. It's a convenient length on VHF

2. It is smaller, less expensive and easier to erect than a dipole or vertical antenna
3. It provides the highest possible angle of radiation for the HF bands
4. It helps reduce interference from other stations off to the side or behind
> 20-metre is an amateur band with global reach.  It is open during day time even during solar cycle lows.  The directive antenna pattern of a Yagi permits reducing interference by focusing energy in one direction only.

1. 7 dB
2. 13 dB
3. 20 dB
4. 10 dB
> This is a trick question.  Two identical antennas side by side doubles the radiated power.  An increase of 2 in power is a gain of +3 dB.  The gain of the array becomes 10 dB + 3 dB = 13 dB.

> key words: half-wavelength DIPOLE.  Wavelength (lambda) in metres IN FREE SPACE is 300 divided by frequency in Megahertz.  A 'dipole' is approximately 95 % of one half wavelength in free space = '(300 / 2) * 0.95' divided by frequency in Megahertz.  In this example, the dipole must be (300 / 28.55 MHz / 2) * 0.95 = 4.99 m .  The frequency is in the 10-metre band of 28.0 to 29.7 MHz, a dipole there must be 5 metres long.

1. It usually produces vertically polarized radiation
2. It must be longer than 1 wavelength
3. You may experience RF feedback in your station
4. You must use an inverted T matching network for multi-band operation
> Because the 'random wire antenna' frequently originates right at the back of the antenna tuner in your station.  "Stray Radio-Frequency" can be a problem.

B-006-12-6 (4) How does the bandwidth of a folded dipole antenna compare with that of a simple dipole antenna?
1. It is essentially the same
2. It is less than 50%
3. It is 0.707 times the bandwidth
4. It is greater
> 'Antenna Bandwidth' is the range of frequencies over which Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) is acceptable.  The Folded Dipole can be operated over a wider range of frequencies than a regular dipole.

B-006-12-7 (2) What is a disadvantage of using an antenna equipped with traps?
1. It is too sharply directional at lower frequencies
2. It will radiate harmonics
3. It must be neutralized
4. It can only be used for one band
> An antenna with traps is a multi-band antenna (i.e., resonant at more than one frequency).  If the transmitter leaks harmonic energy (multiples of the operating energy), this harmonic energy may be more readily radiated by a multi-band antenna.  For example, traps are inserted in an antenna for 80-metre to permit operation on 40-metre;  if your transmitter puts out 'harmonics' while you operate on 80-m ( say, 3.5 MHz ), the second harmonic falls in the 40-m band.  The antenna is also resonant at that frequency and would freely radiate the harmonics.

B-006-12-8 (1) What is an advantage of using a trap antenna?
1. It may be used for multi-band operation
2. It has high directivity at the higher frequencies
3. It has high gain
4. It minimizes harmonic radiation
> The only reason why antenna traps (parallel resonant circuits) are useful is to permit operation on more than one band from the same physical antenna.  Through their high impedance at resonance, traps shorten the antenna by making the antenna sections beyond them inaccessible.

1. length of the line
2. physical dimensions and relative positions of the conductors
3. frequency at which the line is operated
4. load placed on the line
> Characteristic Impedance is determined by the physical dimensions of the line.  Length, frequency or load have nothing to do with it.

2. 600 ohm open-wire
3. 75 ohm twin-lead

B-006-1-6 (4) The characteristic impedance of a transmission line is:
1. the impedance of a section of the line one wavelength long
2. the dynamic impedance of the line at the operating frequency
3. the ratio of the power supplied to the line to the power delivered to the termination
4. equal to the pure resistance which, if connected to the end of the line, will absorb all the power arriving along it
> If a resistor of the same value as the Characteristic Impedance of a given line is placed at the end of that line, no energy is reflected.  100% of the incoming energy is dissipated in the terminating load.

B-006-1-7 (3) A transmission line differs from an ordinary circuit or network in communications or signaling devices in one very important way. That important aspect is:

2. It would be reduced by 10%
3. It would be increased by 10%
4. It would be reduced to 50%
> If line length is doubled, the incurred signal loss is doubled.  Loss for transmission lines is specified as "decibels per 100 feet (30m)" at a certain frequency.

A Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) of '1.5 to 1' would indicate a fairly good match while a very high SWR would indicate a short-circuit or an open-circuit somewhere along the transmission line.

1. The transmitter is putting out more power than normal, showing that it is about to go bad
2. The antenna is the wrong length, or there may be an open or shorted connection somewhere in the feed line
3. There is a large amount of solar radiation, which means very poor radio conditions
4. The signals coming from the antenna are unusually strong, which means very good radio conditions
> SWR is a measure of the impedance match in the antenna system.  A very high SWR, indicating that most if not all energy sent up the line is reflected back indicates that the antenna is cut for a totally different frequency  OR  that a short-circuit or open-circuit exists somewhere along the line.

4. The ratio of maximum to minimum impedances on a feed line
> 'Standing Waves' result from the interaction of the forward power sent from the transmitter towards the antenna  and  the reverse power reflected back by an improper impedance match.  The interaction produces a repeating pattern of voltage peaks and troughs along the line.  SWR is also known as 'Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)':  it is a measure of the peak voltage to the minimum voltage on the standing wave.

B-006-5-6 (4) If your antenna feed line gets hot when you are transmitting, what might this mean?
1. You should transmit using less power
2. The conductors in the feed line are not insulated very well

1. perfect impedance match between transmitter and feedline
2. maximum transfer of energy to the antenna from the transmitter
3. lack of radiation from the transmission line
4. reduced transfer of RF energy to the antenna
> High SWR add to line losses and lead to energy wasted as heat.

B-006-5-10 (3) A resonant antenna having a feed point impedance of 200 ohms is connected to a feed line and transmitter which have an impedance of 50 ohms. What will the standing wave ratio of this system be?
1.  6:1
2.  3:1
3.  4:1
4.  5:1
> key word:  RESONANT.  A resonant antenna (reactances cancel each other at resonance) does not present any reactance (X) but only a 'radiation resistance'.  In such a situation, SWR can be computed as the ratio of the impedances.  In this example, 200 / 50 yields a ratio of '4 to 1'.  SWR is normally a ratio of maximum to minimum voltage on the standing wave.

2. low ohmic resistance
3. matching of impedances
4. inductive impedance

B-006-6-9 (4) If an antenna is correctly matched to a transmitter, the length of transmission line:
1. must be a full wavelength long
2. must be an odd number of quarter-wave
3. must be an even number of half-waves
4. will have no effect on the matching
> IF a mismatch is present at the end of the transmission lines, certain lengths may introduce an 'impedance transformation' effect.  With a correctly matched antenna, line length is immaterial except for line losses if the line is unnecessarily long.

B-006-6-10 (2) The reason that an RF transmission line should be matched at the transmitter end is to:
1. ensure that the radiated signal has the intended polarization
2. transfer the maximum amount of power to the antenna
3. prevent frequency drift
4. overcome fading of the transmitted signal
> Impedance Match:  maximum power transfer occurs when the impedance of the load matches the internal impedance of the source.  For example, A transmitter designed to work into an impedance of 50 ohms, will delivered maximum power if the antenna system offers an impedance of 50 ohms.

B-007-1-7 (4) At HF frequencies, line-of-sight transmission between two stations uses mainly the:
1. troposphere
2. skip wave
3. ionosphere
4. ground wave
> This question is ambiguous.  Yes, until you reach the radio horizon (1.15 times the visible horizon), both the ground wave and the direct wave are undistinguishable.  However, while neither are significantly enhanced by conditions in the troposphere, both travel through the troposphere.  Line-of-sight generally refers to VHF and up.

2. The ground wave and the sky wave continually shift the polarization
3. Anomalies in the earth's magnetic field produce a profound effect on HF polarization
4. Greater selectivity is possible with HF receivers making changes in polarization redundant

2. Too much current from the power supply
3. Interference caused by strong signals from a nearby transmitter
4. Too much voltage from the power supply
> 'Receiver Overload', also known as 'Front-End Overload' or 'RF Overload', is a problem where the early stages of a receiver (i.e., RF amplifier or Mixer) are overwhelmed by some strong nearby transmitter.  For example, TV reception is affected by an HF transmitter.  In the case of 'Overload', the exact transmit frequency does not seem to matter:  the effect is the same for a broad range of transmit frequencies.  This contrasts with 'Harmonics' where a multiple of a given transmit frequency is the cause of the interference.

B-008-1-2 (3) What is one way to tell if radio frequency interference to a receiver is caused by front-end overload?
1. If grounding the receiver makes the problem worse
2. If connecting a low pass filter to the receiver greatly cuts down the interference
3. If the interference is about the same no matter what frequency is used for the transmitter

1. High-pass
2. Low-pass
3. Band-pass
4. No filter
> key words:  TV, OVERLOAD, HF.  TV Channels begin at 54 MHz; the HF range ends at 30 MHz.  To prevent overload to a TV receiver from an HF transmitter, a HIGH-PASS filter can be installed on the TV receiver to allow higher frequencies through while attenuating lower frequencies.  The object of the filtering being to keep the HF signals out of the TV receiver.

B-008-1-5 (2) When the signal from a transmitter overloads the audio stages of a broadcast receiver, the transmitted signal:

2. can appear wherever the receiver is tuned
3. appears only on one frequency
4. appears only when a station is tuned
> key words:  AUDIO STAGES.  Such interference is termed 'Audio Rectification', a special case of overload.  If you recall your receiver block diagrams, Audio Amplification is the last stage of the receiver.

1. Bypass resistors
2. Metal-oxide varistors
3. Bypass capacitors
4. Bypass inductors
> A frequent cause of interference to home entertainment systems is that the long speaker leads act as antennas and bring radio energy into the audio amplifier stages. 'Bypass Capacitors', connected between the speaker leads and the chassis, can provide a low impedance path to divert the RF energy without affecting audio frequencies.

B-008-2-2 (3) What should be done if a properly operating amateur station is the cause of interference to a nearby telephone?
1. Ground and shield the local telephone distribution amplifier
2. Stop transmitting whenever the telephone is in use 
3. Ask the telephone company to install RFI filters
4. Make internal adjustments to the telephone equipment
> "RFI Filter" = Radio-Frequency Interference Filter.  Much like home entertainment systems with their long speaker leads acting as antennas, wire-line telephones with cabling running through the house and streets can easily pickup RF energy.  Filters installed at the telephone set usually solve the problem.  [Note:  this question was written up at a time when phone companies necessarily owned all telephone equipment.  Today, you may have to get and install the filters yourself.] 

B-008-2-3 (3) What sound is heard from a public-address system if audio rectification of a nearby single-sideband phone transmission occurs?

4. A steady hum whenever the transmitter's carrier is on the air
> Much like home entertainment systems, the long speaker leads in a Public-Address sound system act as antennas and bring radio energy into the audio amplifier stages.

1. By installing bypass capacitors on all power supply rectifiers
2. By using CW emission only
3. By ensuring that all station equipment is properly grounded
4. By using a solid-state transmitter
> Properly grounding all station equipment minimizes the radiation of RF which may couple into house wiring and affect other devices in the household.
 
B-008-2-6 (2) An amateur transmitter is being heard across the entire dial of a broadcast receiver. The receiver is most probably suffering from:
1. harmonics interference from the transmitter
2. cross-modulation or audio rectification in the receiver
3. poor image rejection
4. splatter from the transmitter
> key words:  ACROSS THE DIAL.  This has to be a case of OVERLOAD.  'Cross-Modulation' and 'Audio Rectification' are two manifestations of overload.  All other choices would not appear 'across the dial':  an 'Harmonic' falls on a precise frequency, 'Splatter' is limited to a few kilohertz.

B-008-2-7 (1) Cross-modulation is usually caused by:
1. rectification of strong signals
2. harmonics generated at the transmitter
3. improper filtering in the transmitter
4. lack of receiver sensitivity and selectivity
> key words:  STRONG SIGNAL.  'Cross-Modulation' is a special case of overload.  Nothing needs to be wrong with the affected receiver or the transmitter.  It is simply that the receiver is exposed to more radio energy that it can handle.  'Rectification' leads to 'detection':  any semiconductor device may start acting like a diode and perform the two functions.

B-008-2-8 (4) What device can be used to minimize the effect of RF pickup by audio wires connected to stereo speakers, intercom amplifiers, telephones, etc.?
1. Magnet
2. Attenuator
3. Diode
4. Ferrite core
> Long wires act as antennas.  The wires should be kept as short as possible.  Winding speaker or telephone wires around a 'ferrite core' makes an Inductor (a coil).  Inductors oppose (inductive reactance) high frequency AC signals such as Radio-Frequency.  The 'ferrite core' makes for more inductance even with only a few turns of wire.  Ferrite is a material with electromagnetic properties.

B-008-2-9 (1) Stereo speaker leads often act as antennas to pick up RF signals. What is one method you can use to minimize this effect?

4. By sending CW more slowly
> 'Key-Clicks' in a CW Transmitter have two manifestations.  One in DISTANT receivers, caused by "too sharp rise and decay times of the carrier", results in clicks being heard several kHz away from your operating frequency.  The other in NEARBY broadcast receivers, caused by "sparking at the key contacts", results in clicks being heard just like from other electrical devices where currents are switched.  A simple 'key-click filter' comprises a choke (an inductor) and a capacitor inserted at the telegraph key.

'Harmonic Radiation' entails integer (whole-number) multiples of the operating frequency.  Apart from proper adjustment of the transmitter, a 'Low-Pass' filter with a cutoff frequency of 30 MHz helps curb harmonics out of an HF transmitter.  Three times 21 MHz (15m) affects TV channel 3 [60-66MHz].  Four times 21 MHz affects channel 6 [82-88MHz].

B-008-4-10 (3) An interfering signal from a transmitter is found to have a frequency of 57 MHz (TV Channel 2 is 54 - 60 MHz). This signal could be the:
