A-001-01-01 (4) What is the meaning of the term "time constant" in an RL circuit?
1. The time required for the current in the circuit to build up to 36.8% of the maximum value
2. The time required for the voltage in the circuit to build up to 63.2% of the maximum value
3. The time required for the voltage in the circuit to build up to 36.8% of the maximum value
4. The time required for the current in the circuit to build up to 63.2% of the maximum value
> Inductance is a property of circuits that oppose changes in current.  The time constant is the time current WOULD need to reach final value IF the initial rate of change COULD be maintained.  The time constant in seconds equals L in henrys divided by R in ohms:  the lower the resistance, the greater the rate of change resulting in greater opposition.  The current after 1, 2 and 5 time constants is respectively 63%, 87% and 100% of the final value.  With capacitors, the ratios are the same but they relate to voltage;  the time constant then becomes R times C.

1. An exponential rate of one
2. One time constant
3. A time factor of one
4. One exponential period
> Capacitance is a property of circuits that oppose changes in voltage.

A-003-06-01 (3) A meter has a full-scale deflection of 40 microamps and an internal resistance of 96 ohms. You want it to read 0 to 1 mA. The value of the shunt to be used is:
1.   24 ohms
2.   16 ohms
3.   4 ohms
4.   40 ohms
> Extending the range of an ammeter supposes placing a shunt resistor across the meter movement to divert part of the current:  the shunt resistor = internal resistance divided by the multiplication factor from which we will first have deducted a quantity of one.  For example, making a 40 microamperes movement, with a 96 ohms internal resistance, read 1000 microamperes at full scale is a factor of 25:  the shunt = 96 ohms divided by 24 (i.e., 25 minus 1) = 4 ohms.  Method B:  you could have computed voltage across the meter as 40 times 96 = 3840 microvolts ; and then, computed the shunt resistor as 3840 microvolts divided by 960 microamperes = 4 ohms. 

A-003-06-02 (2) A moving-coil milliammeter having a full-scale deflection of 1 mA and an internal resistance of 0.5 ohms is to be converted to a voltmeter of 20 volts full-scale deflection. It would be necessary to insert a:
1. series resistance of 1999.5 ohms
2. series resistance of 19 999.5 ohms
3. shunt resistance of 19 999.5 ohms
4. shunt resistance of 19.5 ohms
> Turning an ammeter into a voltmeter supposes inserting a suitable resistor in series with the instrument.  For a current of 1 milliampere to flow under 20 Volts, Ohm's Law tells us that a total resistance of 20 000 ohms is required.  Subtract the internal resistance from that number and the actual series resistance needed is 19 999.5 ohms.

A-003-06-03 (4) A voltmeter having a range of 150 volts and an internal resistance of 150 000 ohms is to be extended to read 750 volts. The required multiplier resistor would have a value of:
1.   1500 ohms
2.   750 000 ohms
3.   1 200 000 ohms
4.   600 000 ohms
> Extending the range of a voltmeter supposes placing a suitable multiplier resistor in series with the instrument:  the multiplier resistance = total internal resistance times the multiplication factor from which we will first have deducted a quantity of one.  For example, to turn a 150 Volts meter, with an internal resistance of 150 000 ohms, to read 750 Volts full scale is an increase of 5 times:  the multiplier resistor = 150 000 times 4 (i.e., 5 minus 1) = 600 000 ohms.  Method B:  current for full-scale reading = 150 volts divided by 150 000 ohms = 1 milliampere.  The total resistance that would allow 1 milliampere under 750 volts = 750 000 ohms.  Deduct the internal resistance from this value to determine the multiplier resistor.

A-003-06-04 (1) The sensitivity of an ammeter is an expression of:
1. the amount of current causing full-scale deflection
2. the resistance of the meter
3. the loading effect the meter will have on a circuit
4. the value of the shunt resistor
> Ammeter sensitivity is the current needed for a full-scale deflection.

A-003-06-05 (1) Voltmeter sensitivity is usually expressed in ohms per volt. This means that a voltmeter with a sensitivity of 20 kilohms per volt would be a:
1.   50 microampere meter
2.   1 milliampere meter
3.   50 milliampere meter
4.   100 milliampere meter
> Voltmeter sensitivity in ohms per volt:  i.e., the full-scale reading times the sensitivity yields total instrument resistance.  Given total resistance, sensitivity can be computed as resistance divided by full-scale voltage reading:  e.g., a total of 150 000 ohms for a voltmeter reading 150 Volts is a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per Volt.  Given sensitivity, the current needed for full-scale voltmeter reading follows Ohm's Law:  e.g., a voltmeter with a sensitivity of 20 000 ohms per Volt uses a 50 microampere movement ( I = 1 Volt divided by 20 000 = 50 microamperes ).

A-003-06-06 (2) The sensitivity of a voltmeter, whose resistance is 150 000 ohms on the 150-volt range, is:
1.   100 000 ohms per volt
2.   1000 ohms per volt
3.   10 000 ohms per volt
4.   150 ohms per volt
> Voltmeter sensitivity in ohms per volt:  i.e., the full-scale reading times the sensitivity yields total instrument resistance.  Given total resistance, sensitivity can be computed as resistance divided by full-scale voltage reading:  e.g., a total of 150 000 ohms for a voltmeter reading 150 Volts is a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per Volt.

3. connecting an external resistance in parallel with the internal resistance
4. changing the internal capacitance of the meter to resonance
> Extending the range of an ammeter supposes placing a shunt resistor across the meter movement to divert part of the current:  the shunt resistor = internal resistance divided by the multiplication factor from which we will first have deducted a quantity of one.

A-004-01-01 (3) For the same transformer secondary voltage, which rectifier has the highest average output voltage?
1. Half-wave
2. Quarter-wave
3. Bridge
4. Full-wave
> The half-wave configuration is not as efficient at rectification as the full-wave.  The real choice lies between the two full-wave alternatives:  bridge or full-wave with centre-tap.  The bridge configuration rectifies the full secondary winding voltage.  In contrast, the two-diode with centre-tapped transformer secondary only rectifies half the secondary voltage on each half-cycle.

A-004-01-02 (2) In a half-wave power supply with a capacitor input filter and a load drawing little or no current, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) across the diode can reach _____ times the RMS voltage.
1.   0.45
2.   2.8
3.   5.6
4.   1.4
> During conduction, the capacitor charges up to the peak value of the waveform (1.4 times the RMS value). On the opposite half-cycle, and from the diode's standpoint, the transformer winding reaching opposite peak value (1.4 times the RMS value) adds to the capacitor charge for a total of 2.8 times the RMS value.

A-004-01-03 (2) In a full-wave centre-tap power supply, regardless of load conditions, the peak inverse voltage (PIV) will be _____ times the RMS voltage:
1.   0.636
2.   2.8
3.   0.707
4.   1.4
> With the RMS voltage defined in this example as the voltage from one extremity of the secondary winding to the centre-tap, each diode is subjected to 2.8 times the RMS voltage, peak reverse voltage from half the transformer winding adds to the peak DC output as a reverse bias on the diode during non-conduction ( each diode serves as a half-wave rectifier ).

A-004-01-04 (3) A full-wave bridge rectifier circuit makes use of both halves of the AC cycle, but unlike the full-wave centre-tap rectifier circuit it does not require:
1. any output filtering
2. a centre-tapped primary on the transformer
3. a centre-tapped secondary on the transformer
4. diodes across each leg of the transformer
> A four-diode bridge rectifier makes use of the full secondary winding without the need for a centre-tap.

2. half that of the full-wave centre-tap rectifier
3. the same as the full-wave centre-tap rectifier
4. the same as the half-wave rectifier
> This question is ambiguous.  It does not seem to ask what you can get out of a single physical transformer but seeks to compare configurations in broad terms.  In that context, the bridge configuration and the full-wave centre-tap configuration produce nearly the same output.

A-004-02-06 (1) The main function of the bleeder resistor in a power supply is to provide a discharge path for the capacitor in the power supply. But it may also be used for a secondary function, which is to:
1. improve voltage regulation
2. provide a ground return for the transformer
3. inhibit the flow of current through the supply
4. act as a secondary smoothing device in conjunction with the filter
> Regulation is the change in voltage from no-load to full-load.  By ensuring a certain minimum current draw on the supply, the bleeder prevents the capacitors from fully charging up to peak AC values when no external load is connected.

A-004-02-07 (1) In a power supply, series chokes will:
1. readily pass the DC but will impede the flow of the AC component
2. readily pass the DC and the AC component
3. impede the passage of DC but will pass the AC component
4. impede both DC and AC
> Inductors oppose changes in current.  Stable DC current is not affected but AC ripple is minimized.

A-004-02-08 (4) When using a choke input filter, a minimum current should be drawn all the time when the device is switched on. This can be accomplished by:
1. utilizing a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit
2. placing an ammeter in the output circuit
3. increasing the value of the output capacitor
4. adjusting the bleeder resistance
> Only answer 4 has an impact on DC current flowing through the filter whether an external load is connected or not.

A-004-02-09 (3) In the design of a power supply, the designer must be careful of resonance effects because the ripple voltage could build up to a high value. The components that must be carefully selected are:

2. parallel resonant circuit with the first choke and second capacitor
3. series resonant circuit with the first choke and first capacitor
4. tuned inductance in the filter choke
> Series resonance in the first choke and first capacitor across the rectifier may cause excessive rectifier peak current and abnormally high peak reverse voltages on the diodes.

A-004-02-11 (3) In a properly designed choke input filter power supply, the no-load voltage across the filter capacitor will be about nine-tenths of the AC RMS voltage; yet it is advisable to use capacitors rated at the peak transformer voltage. Why is this large safety margin suggested?
1. Resonance can be set up in the filter producing high voltages
2. Under heavy load, high currents and voltages are produced
3. Under no-load conditions and a burned-out bleeder, voltages could reach the peak transformer voltage
4. Under no-load conditions, the current could reach a high level
> Inductors oppose changes in current.  If no current at all is drawn from a choke-input filter, the effect of the inductor vanishes:  no more counter-EMF or opposition to peak capacitor charging current.  Subsequent capacitors are allowed to fully charge to peak AC values.  [ nine tenths the RMS:  RMS is 0.707 times peak, average is 0.637 times peak, 0.637 is nine tenths of 0.707 ]

A transformer at the output of the oscillator serves the dual purpose of tuned circuit and coupling to the next stage.  The DC supply to the final amplifier is bypassed to ground with a capacitor and decoupled through an RF choke so RF is kept out of the supply.

1. Colpitts
2. Hartley
3. Franklin
4. Pierce
> Hartley = a tap on the inductor of the tuned circuit permits inserting positive feedback from output to input.  Colpitts = the inductor tap of the Hartley is replaced by two series capacitors in a capacitive divider configuration.  Relatively large capacitor values, when compared to the Hartley, mean less influence from internal capacitance changes in the device, hence stability.  Pierce = derived from the Colpitts, a piezoelectric crystal replaces the tuned circuit.  Capacitive coupling maintains oscillation.

A-005-02-01 (2) The output tuning controls on a transmitter power amplifier:
1. allow switching to different antennas
2. allow efficient transfer of power to the antenna
3. reduce the possibility of cross-modulation in adjunct receivers
4. are involved with frequency multiplication in the previous stage
> Tube power amplifiers always include a matching network to match the high impedance of the tube to the antenna system impedance.  As always, impedance match is all about maximum power transfer.

A-005-02-02 (1) The purpose of using a centre-tap return connection on the secondary of transmitting tube's filament transformer is to:

3. keep the output voltage constant with a varying load
4. obtain optimum power output
> When the cathode is simply the filament (a "directly-heated cathode"), the voltage drop across the filament (e.g., 6.3 Volts AC) is in series with the cathode DC reference voltage:  as an example, while one side of the filament might be at a certain DC voltage, the other extremity is at some other value, a value influenced by the AC voltage impressed on the filament.  Electron flow is affected by an AC variation, hum results.

3.   a greater bandpass requirement in the receiver
4.   3 db gain in the transmitter
> Under noisy conditions, SSB can bring up to a 9 dB improvement over an AM signal of the same peak power.  In AM, the Peak Envelope Power present in one of the two sidebands equals one fourth the carrier power:  e.g., a 100-Watt AM transmitter only packs 25 Watts PEP in each sideband.  SSB concentrates all the available power in one sideband alone:  a 4 to 1 improvement or 6dB.

4. The transmitter's carrier is properly suppressed
> Flattening of the peaks is an extreme form of distortion where the output of the transmitter is incapable of reproducing the original pattern of the audio input on voice peaks.  This is generally caused by excessive audio input to the transmitter:  too much audio causes the amplifier stage to exceed its linear operation range.  The purpose of the ALC (Automatic Level Control) is to prevent overdrive.

' Part of 005-07 follows...

A-005-07-01 (1) Maintaining the peak RF output of a SSB transmitter at a relatively constant level requires a circuit called the:
1. automatic level control (ALC)
2. automatic gain control (AGC)
3. automatic output control (AOC)
4. automatic volume control (AVC)
> Automatic Level Control (ALC) serves to prevent overdriving an amplifier.  The ALC circuit samples the envelope (peak) of the RF output to develop a DC control voltage used to control the gain of an earlier stage.  AGC and AVC are receiver circuits.

A-005-07-02 (1) Speech compression associated with SSB transmission implies:
1. full amplification of low level signals and reducing or eliminating amplification of high level signals
2. full amplification of high level signals and reducing or eliminating signals amplification of low level
3. a lower signal-to-noise ratio
4. circuit level instability
> Audio compression maintains a high voice level despite variations in the voice signal incoming from a microphone.  To produce a high average output without exceeding a certain peak value, low level signals need to be amplified while high level signals are passed along with little or no gain.  [ compression is the automatic reduction of gain as the signal level increases beyond a preset level known as the threshold. ]

A-005-07-07 (2) Which principle IS NOT associated with analog signal processing?
1. compression
2. frequency division
3. bandwidth limiting
4. clipping
> key words:  NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANALOG.  Compression, bandwidth limiting and clipping can all be performed as analog processes.  Frequency division requires a numerical computation.

A-005-07-08 (2) Which of the following IS NOT a method used for peak limiting, in a signal processor?
1. RF clipping
2. frequency clipping
3. compression
4. AF clipping
> The expression "peak limiting" entails limiting the amplitude.  Compression, AF clipping and RF clipping are valid operations.  There is no such thing as frequency clipping.

A-005-07-09 (3) What is the undesirable result of AF clipping in a speech processor?
1. Reduced average power
2. Increased average power
3. Increased harmonic distortion
4. Reduction in peak amplitude
> Audio frequency clipping abruptly stops voltage excursions at a certain level.  This gives the audio a square wave appearance;  square waves are rich in harmonics.  AF clippers need to be followed by a low-pass filter to prevent harmonics from entering modulation stages.  You may also eliminate the bad answers:  no. 4 is the object of clipping, no. 2 is a result of clipping (softer passages are no longer dwarfed by the peaks), no. 1 contradicts the second answer.

A-005-07-10 (4) Which description IS NOT correct? You are planning to build a speech processor for your transceiver. Compared to AF clipping, RF clipping:
1. has less distortion
2. is more expensive to implement
3. is more difficult to implement
4. is easier to implement
> Working at radio-frequencies is evidently more difficult and thus more expensive than dealing with audio frequencies.  RF clipping is generally presumed to induce less distortion because any harmonics generated through clipping automatically end up outside the passband of subsequent filters.  At audio frequencies, harmonics of the lower speech frequencies fall within the audio passband and can muddle the audio signal.

A-005-07-11 (1) Automatic Level Control (ALC) is another name for:
1. RF compression
2. AF compression
3. RF clipping
4. AF clipping
> Clipping places a hard limit on voltage swings.  Compression is a reduction in gain when signal exceed a certain threshold.  The ALC circuit samples the envelope (peak) of the RF output and produces a DC control voltage used to control the gain of an earlier stage when the output reaches a certain level.

A-005-05-01 (1) In an FM phone signal having a maximum frequency deviation of 3000 Hz either side of the carrier frequency, what is the modulation index, when the modulating frequency is 1000 Hz?
1.   3
2.   0.3
3.   3000
4.   1000
> Deviation = the amount of frequency shift, at a given instant, from the centre carrier frequency (e.g., plus or minus 5 kHz).  Modulation Index = the ratio of deviation to modulating frequency for a particular audio frequency (both being expressed in the same units):  e.g., 3 kHz deviation with 1 kHz audio represents a Modulation Index of 3.  Deviation Ratio = the ratio of maximum deviation to the maximum modulating frequency:  e.g. maximum deviation of 5 kHz with a highest modulating frequency of 3 kHz is a Deviation Ratio of 1.66 .

A-005-05-05 (4) When the transmitter is not modulated, or the amplitude of the modulating signal is zero, the frequency of the carrier is called its:
1. frequency deviation
2. frequency shift
3. modulating frequency
4. centre frequency
> Centre Frequency is the transmitter output frequency in the absence of modulation.  Frequency deviation and frequency shift both are synonyms for the offset in carrier frequency caused by modulation at a given instant.  Modulating frequency relates to the audio frequency used for modulation.

A-005-05-06 (1) In a FM transmitter system, the number of cycles of deviation from the centre frequency is determined solely by the:
1. amplitude of the modulating frequency
2. frequency of the modulating frequency
3. amplitude and the frequency of the modulating frequency
4. modulating frequency and the amplitude of the centre frequency
> In Frequency Modulation,  the amplitude of the modulation is translated into the importance of the deviation, the modulation frequency is reflected in the rhythm of the deviation.

A-005-05-07 (4) Any FM wave with single-tone modulation has:
1. two sideband frequencies
2. four sideband frequencies
3. one sideband frequency
4. an infinite number of sideband frequencies
> Unlike AM where a single modulating frequency creates only a pair of side frequencies (one on each side of the carrier), FM creates an infinite number of side frequency pairs;  the Modulation Index influences the amplitude of the side frequencies through a mathematical relation known as a Bessel Function.  The number of side frequencies with significant amplitude determines the required bandwidth.  For certain Modulation Index values, there is zero energy at the centre frequency;  the energy is then totally found in the side frequencies.

A-005-05-08 (3) The deviation meter works on the principle of:
1. detecting the frequencies in the sidebands
2. the amplitude of power in the sidebands
3. a carrier null and multiplying the modulation frequency by the modulation index
4. a carrier peak and dividing by the modulation index
> Certain Modulation Index values cause nulls at the centre carrier frequency:  e.g., the Bessel function returns zero for the carrier component at Modulation Indices of 2.4048, 5.5201 or 8.6537 .  Detecting a carrier null permits determining deviation as Modulation Index times modulating frequency.  For example, with a tone of 905 Hertz and deviation set at 4996 Hertz (nearly 5 kHz), a null in the carrier will be observed because 4996 Hz deviation for a tone of 905 Hz is a Modulation Index of 5.52 .  An all-mode receiver with a sharp filter permits observing the carrier component.  The procedure could be used to set a transmitter or calibrate a home-made deviation meter.
' Expressed to 8 decimal places, the first three indices producing Bessel nulls for J(0) are 2.40482556, 5.52007811 and 8.65372791 .

A-005-05-09 (1) When using a deviation meter, it is important to know:
1. modulating frequency and the modulation index
2. modulation index
3. modulating frequency
4. pass-band of the IF filter
> Certain Modulation Index values cause nulls at the centre carrier frequency:  e.g., the Bessel function returns zero for the carrier component at Modulation Indices of 2.4048, 5.5201 or 8.6537 .

A-005-05-10 (3) What is the total bandwidth of an FM-phone transmission having a 5-kHz deviation and a 3-kHz modulating frequency?
1.   8 kHz
2.   5 kHz
3.   16 kHz
4.   3 kHz
> Carson's Rule permits estimating the bandwidth of an FM signal:  bandwidth equals twice the sum of deviation + modulating frequency, in this example,  5 + 3 = 8, twice 8 = 16.  [ Mathematician and engineer John R. Carson (1887-1940) had predicted the approximate bandwidth of an FM signal circa 1922. ]

A-005-05-11 (3) What is the frequency deviation for a 12.21-MHz reactance-modulated oscillator in a 5-kHz deviation, 146.52-MHz FM-phone transmitter?
1.   12 kHz
2.   5 kHz
3.   416.7 Hz
4.   41.67 Hz
> In this example, the frequency multiplication ratio between oscillator and output is 12 ( 146.52 divided by 12.21 = 12 ).  Hence, the oscillator needs only be shifted by 416.7 Hz, i.e., 5000 Hz divided by 12.

{L16} FM and Repeaters

A-005-06-01 (2) If the signals of two repeater transmitters mix together in one or both of their final amplifiers and unwanted signals at the sum and difference frequencies of the original signals are generated, what is this called?
1. Neutralization
2. Intermodulation interference
3. Adjacent channel interference
4. Amplifier desensitization
> Intermodulation is the unwanted mixing of two or more signals that produce new signals (products).  The fundamental or harmonic energy from strong nearby transmitters intermix to create intermodulation products.  Mixing can take place in the front-end of the affected receiver, in the Power Amplifier of one of the transmitters or through "external rectification" (in some electronic device or some corroded junction between two metals acting as a diode mixer).

A-005-06-02 (3) How does intermodulation interference between two repeater transmitters usually occur?
1. When the signals are reflected in phase by aircraft passing overhead
2. When they are in close proximity and the signals cause feedback in one or both of their final amplifiers
3. When they are in close proximity and the signals mix in one or both of their final amplifiers
4. When the signals are reflected out of phase by aircraft passing overhead

A-005-06-03 (3) How can intermodulation interference between two repeater transmitters in close proximity often be reduced or eliminated?
1. By installing a low-pass filter in the antenna feed line
2. By installing a high-pass filter in the antenna feed line
3. By installing a terminated circulator or ferrite isolator in the feed line to the transmitter and duplexer
4. By using a Class C final amplifier with high driving power
> A circulator is usually a three-port device;  any energy coming in one port is forwarded in one direction only, towards the next port.  An isolator is a circulator with one port terminated into a dummy load.  With the transmitter on port 1, the antenna on port 2 and a dummy load on port 3, RF from the transmitter is routed to the antenna but any outside energy picked-up by the antenna is diverted to the dummy load and thus cannot enter the Power Amplifier where it might lead to intermodulation.  Magnetized ferrite material is used in the fabrication of circulators.

A-005-06-04 (4) If a receiver tuned to 146.70 MHz receives an intermodulation product signal whenever a nearby transmitter transmits on 146.52, what are the two most likely frequencies for the other interfering signal?
1.   146.88 MHz and 146.34 MHz
2.   146.01 MHz and 147.30 MHz
3.   73.35 MHz and 239.40 MHz
4.   146.34 MHz and 146.61 MHz
> Third Order Intermodulation products where the second harmonic of one signal mixes with the fundamental frequency of another are the most troublesome because of the relative frequency proximity of the involved signals:  filtering them out is difficult.  Given two signals, F1 and F2, the Third Order IMD product can be computed as (a) "twice F1 minus F2" or (b) "twice F2 minus F1".  In this example, IMD = 146.70, F1 = 146.52 ; solving for F2 in case "a" is (F1 times 2), minus IMD ;  solving for F2 in case "b" is (IMD + F1), divided by 2.

A-005-06-05 (1) What type of circuit varies the tuning of an amplifier tank circuit to produce FM signals?
1. A phase modulator
2. A balanced modulator
3. A double balanced mixer
4. An audio modulator
> Two methods exist to produce Frequency Modulation.  The Direct Method supposes forcing deviation directly on the oscillator;  deviation is then multiplied along with the oscillator frequency up to the operating frequency.  Phase Modulation is an indirect method whereby the phase of the signal is affected (i.e., retarding/advancing) in step with the modulation by varying a reactance on a stage other than the oscillator.

A-005-06-06 (3) What audio shaping network is added at an FM transmitter to attenuate the lower audio frequencies?
1. An audio prescaler
2. A heterodyne suppressor
3. A pre-emphasis network
4. A de-emphasis network
> With direct FM, deviation is independent of modulating frequency, actual deviation is determined solely by the modulating amplitude.  With Phase Modulation, deviation depends on the amount of phase shift and its rapidity, increasing modulating frequency results in proportionally more deviation even if amplitude is held constant.  Because commercial standards were based on Phase Modulation, an FM transmitter requires an artificial boost in high frequency response so that PM and FM sound the same at the receiver.  A pre-emphasis network tailors the frequency response in the FM transmitter.  De-emphasis is employed in the receiver to restore a flat audio response.

A-005-06-07 (2) Which type of filter would be best to use in a 2-metre repeater duplexer?
1. A DSP filter
2. A cavity filter
3. An L-C filter
4. A crystal filter
> In the context of a repeater installation, a duplexer is a specialized filter which allows operating the receiver and transmitter simultaneously on the same antenna.  The duplexer is built with four or more quarter-wavelength cavity resonators.  The duplexer provides isolation ( 90 dB or more on 2m ) between the receive and transmit paths at the expense of insertion loss.

A-005-06-08 (1) The characteristic difference between a phase modulator and a frequency modulator is:
1. pre-emphasis
2. the centre frequency
3. de-emphasis
4. frequency inversion
> With direct FM, deviation is independent of modulating frequency, actual deviation is determined solely by the modulating amplitude.

A pre-emphasis network tailors the frequency response in the FM transmitter.  De-emphasis is employed in the receiver to restore a flat audio response.

A-005-06-09 (4) In most modern FM transmitters, to produce a better sound, a compressor and a clipper are placed:
1. between the multiplier and the PA
2. between the modulator and the oscillator
3. in the microphone circuit, before the audio amplifier
4. between the audio amplifier and the modulator
> In this context, compression and clipping are AUDIO processes aimed at maintaining high average deviation without exceeding a given peak value.  Answers #1 and #2 can be scratched as they pertain to radiofrequency paths.  Answer #3 is not suitable as the audio level at that point is too low for a simple clipper.

A-005-06-10 (1) Three important parameters to be verified in an FM transmitter are:
1. linearity, frequency deviation and frequency stability
2. distortion, bandwidth and sideband power
3. modulation, pre-emphasis and carrier suppression
4. frequency stability, de-emphasis and linearity
> Stability is paramount in all transmitters, frequency deviation ultimately determines bandwidth while linearity (absence of distortion) minimizes out-of-channel emissions.  Carrier Suppression is a concern with SSB, pre-emphasis (FM transmitter) and de-emphasis (FM receiver) are simple resistor-capacitor networks.

A-005-06-11 (2) For a repeater to operate automatically, the circuit that determines when to turn the transmitter on and off is the:
1. limiter
2. carrier operated relay
3. automatic identifier
4. multiplier
> The Carrier Operated Relay (COR) is the circuit which detects an incoming signal at the receiver.  In a simplistic repeater, the COR would in turn activate the transmitter.  In real-life, the COR signal is taken through a controller where a time-out timer (to prevent overly long transmissions), a "tail" timer (hang time, to keep the repeater on the air between exchanges), a courtesy tone (or "tail beep", to signal the reset of the time-out timer) and an identifier (to transmit the repeater's call sign) are implemented.

4. The larger character set allows store-and-forward
> With 5 bits, Baudot can accommodate 32 combinations ( 2 exponent 5 ) per character set;  one set represents uppercase letters A through Z, the other are figures 0 through 9 plus other symbols.  The original ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) used seven bits to accommodate 128 combinations;  enough for lowercase and uppercase letters, all digits and other symbols.

1. It requires narrower bandwidth than most receivers have
2. It varies too quickly in amplitude
3. The signal is too distorted for comfortable listening
4. Your receiver must be frequency-synchronized to the transmitter
> Spread-spectrum transmission relies on a wide range of frequencies rather than a single one to reduce the effects of noise and interference.  It requires several megahertz of bandwidth.

A-005-09-10 (2) Why are received spread-spectrum signals so resistant to interference?
1. The receiver is always equipped with a special digital signal processor (DSP) interference filter
2. Signals not using the spectrum-spreading algorithm are suppressed in the receiver
3. If interference is detected by the receiver, it will signal the transmitter to change frequencies
4. The high power used by a spread-spectrum transmitter keeps its signal from being easily overpowered

1. The frequency of an RF carrier is changed very rapidly according to a particular pseudo-random sequence
2. If interference is detected by the receiver, it will signal the transmitter to change frequency

2. Automatic soft-limiting and automatic squelching
3. Increased selectivity and optimal tuned circuit design
4. Automatic squelching and increased sensitivity
> Down-converting the operating frequency to a lower Intermediate Frequency facilitates selectivity:  for example, 0.6% of 455 kilohertz is 2.7 kHz, 0.6% of 3.7 megahertz is 22 kHz.

A-006-01-02 (1) What factors should be considered when selecting an intermediate frequency?
1. Image rejection
2. Noise figure and distortion
3. Interference to other services
4. Cross-modulation distortion and interference
> Two frequencies, one above and one below the Local Oscillator frequency, can produce a mixing result at the Intermediate Frequency.  The one resulting in the unwanted product is the Image Frequency.  With a low Intermediate Frequency, selectivity and gain are easier to achieve but image rejection suffers.  With a high Intermediate Frequency, image rejection is facilitated but selectivity is more difficult to achieve.  A Double-conversion receiver deals with image rejection with an initial conversion and restores selectivity with a subsequent down-conversion.  Two conversions, however, expose the designer to twice the risk of spurious responses due to spurious oscillations in local oscillators.

A-006-01-05 (1) A multiconversion superheterodyne receiver is more susceptible to spurious responses than a single-conversion receiver because of the:
1. additional oscillators and mixing frequencies involved in the design
2. poorer selectivity in the IF caused by the multitude of frequency changes
3. greater sensitivity introducing higher levels of RF to the receiver
4. AGC being forced to work harder causing the stages concerned to overload

2.   21 MHz
3.   9 MHz

A-006-02-01 (4) The mixer stage of a superheterodyne receiver is used to:
1. allow a number of IF frequencies to be used
2. remove image signals from the receiver
3. produce an audio frequency for the speaker
4. change the frequency of the incoming signal to that of the IF

A-006-02-02 (1) A superheterodyne receiver designed for SSB reception must have a beat-frequency oscillator (BFO) because:
1. the suppressed carrier must be replaced for detection
2. it phases out the unwanted sideband signal
3. it reduces the pass-band of the IF stages
4. it beats with the receiver carrier to produce the missing sideband
> The Beat Frequency Oscillator feeds the Product Detector for CW and SSB detection.  Mixing the Intermediate Frequency with the BFO signal in the Product Detector produces an audio output.  In Single Sideband, it is said to "reinsert the carrier" as it recreates a reference at the exact frequency at which the carrier, suppressed at the transmitter, would have appeared out of the Intermediate Frequency chain.

A-006-02-03 (4) The first mixer in the receiver mixes the incoming signal with the local oscillator to produce:

2. a radio frequency
3. a high frequency oscillator (HFO) frequency
4. an intermediate frequency

3.   10 600 kHz
4.   21 600 kHz
> In a superheterodyne receiver, injection from the Local Oscillator can be above or below the operating frequency.  There could be two answers:  Intermediate Frequency plus operating frequency or Intermediate Frequency minus operating frequency.

A-006-02-05 (1) The BFO is off-set slightly (500 - 1500 Hz) from the incoming signal to the detector. This is required:
1. to beat with the incoming signal
2. to pass the signal without interruption
3. to provide additional amplification
4. to protect the incoming signal from interference
> The Beat Frequency Oscillator feeds the Product Detector for CW and SSB detection.  Mixing the Intermediate Frequency with the BFO signal in the Product Detector produces an audio output.  In Single Sideband, it is said to "reinsert the carrier" as it recreates a reference at the exact frequency at which the carrier, suppressed at the transmitter, would have appeared out of the Intermediate Frequency chain.

1. stable and spectrally pure
2. sensitive and selective
3. stable and sensitive
4. selective and spectrally pure
> Oscillators need to be free of drift regardless of voltage and temperature variations or mechanical vibrations.  Spectral purity is the absence of harmonics, other spurious oscillations or noise;  purity limits spurious responses in the subsequent mixing processes.

A-006-02-07 (4) In a superhetrodyne receiver, a stage before the IF amplifier has a variable capacitor in parallel with a trimmer capacitor and an inductance. The variable capacitor is for:

2. tuning of the beat-frequency oscillator (BFO)
3. tuning both the antenna and the HFO
4. tuning of the high-frequency oscillator (HFO)
> Two stages may require tuning ahead of the Intermediate Frequency amplifier:  the preselector and the high-frequency oscillator, commonly known as the Local Oscillator.  As the question alludes to one trimmer and one inductance, only one circuit can be tuned.

A-006-02-08 (4) In a superhetrodyne receiver without an RF amplifier, the input to the mixer stage has a variable capacitor in parallel with an inductance. The variable capacitor is for:
1. tuning both the antenna and the BFO
2. tuning the beat-frequency oscillator (BFO)
3. tuning both the antenna and the HFO
4. tuning of the antenna

2. produces spurious signals
3. acts as a buffer stage
4. demodulates SSB signals

2. The minimum level of noise that will overload the receiver RF amplifier stage
3. The amount of noise generated by the receiver local oscillator
4. The weakest signal that can be detected above the receiver internal noise
> A receiver's "Noise Floor" is the power level at which an incoming signal exhibits a Signal-To-Noise ratio of zero decibel:  that is, the signal power equals the internal noise power level.  Noise Floor is evaluated while measuring "Minimum Discernible Signal (MDS)".  The "Noise Figure" of a receiver is a comparison of Signal-to-Noise ratio at the input and Signal-to-Noise ratio at the output;  it assesses the degradation in Signal-to-Noise ratio caused by added noise.  A low Noise Figure suggests that little noise was added internally and is a hallmark of sensitivity.  The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

A-006-03-02 (2) Which of the following is a purpose of the first IF amplifier stage in a receiver?
1. To tune out cross-modulation distortion
2. To improve selectivity
3. To increase dynamic response
4. To improve noise figure performance
> The Intermediate Frequency chain is responsible for the selectivity and a large part of the gain.  The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

1. As much gain as possible, short of self-oscillation
2. Sufficient gain to allow weak signals to overcome noise generated in the first mixer stage
3. It depends on the amplification factor of the first IF stage
4. Sufficient gain to keep weak signals below the noise of the first mixer stage
> The Radio-Frequency Amplifier should only introduce enough gain to override the internal noise of the subsequent Mixer.  Too much gain will degrade Dynamic Range;  Dynamic Range is broadly defined as a ratio between the strongest signals that can be tolerated near the passband and the "Minimum Discernible Signal".

A-006-03-04 (4) What is the primary purpose of an RF amplifier in a receiver?
1. To vary the receiver image rejection by using the AGC
2. To develop the AGC voltage
3. To provide most of the receiver gain
4. To improve the receiver noise figure
> The Intermediate Frequency chain is responsible for the selectivity and a large part of the gain.  The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

A-006-03-05 (3) What is the primary source of noise that can be heard in a VHF/UHF band receiver with its antenna connected?
1. Detector noise
2. Atmospheric noise
3. Receiver front-end noise
4. Man-made noise
> key word:  UHF.  Below 30 megahertz, the antenna picks-up atmospheric noise and man-made noise at levels far more important than internal noise.  As the frequency of operation rises, those types of noise become less prevalent.  On Ultra High Frequencies (UHF) and above, the internal noise becomes the limiting factor in receiving weak signals.  The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver:  for weak signal work on 2 metres and up, more attention must be placed on reducing internal noise in the front-end.

A-006-03-06 (2) What is the term used for the decibel difference (or ratio) between the largest tolerable receiver input signal (without causing audible distortion products) and the minimum discernible signal (sensitivity)?

A low Noise Figure suggests that little noise was added internally and is a hallmark of sensitivity.  The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

A-006-03-07 (3) The lower the receiver noise figure becomes, the greater will be the receiver's _________ :
1. rejection of unwanted signals
2. selectivity
3. sensitivity
4. stability
> The "Noise Figure" of a receiver is a comparison of Signal-to-Noise ratio at the input and Signal-to-Noise ratio at the output;  it assesses the degradation in Signal-to-Noise ratio caused by added noise.

2. BFO and detector
3. RF amplifier and mixer
4. IF amplifier and detector

The front-end of the receiver, where signals are weakest, is responsible for the noise performance of a receiver.

A-006-03-09 (2) Why are very low noise figures relatively unimportant for a high frequency receiver?
1. ionospheric distortion of the received signal creates high noise levels
2. external HF noise, man-made and natural, are higher than the internal noise generated by the receiver
3. the use of SSB and CW on the HF bands overcomes the noise
4. regardless of the front end, the succeeding stages when used on HF are very noisy
> Below 30 MHz, atmospheric noise and man-made noise are much larger than internal noise.

A-006-03-10 (1) The term which relates specifically to the amplitude levels of multiple signals that can be accommodated during reception is called:
1. dynamic range
2. AGC
3. cross-modulation index
4. noise figure
> Dynamic Range is broadly defined as a ratio between the strongest signals that can be tolerated near the passband and the "Minimum Discernible Signal".  Other related notions include Blocking Dynamic Range and Intermodulation Dynamic Range.  Blocking Dynamic Range measures how much of a single strong off-channel signal can be tolerated while receiving a weak signal, it is a measure of desensitization or immunity to overload.  Intermodulation Dynamic Range verifies how strong two off-channel signals can be without spurious responses being generated in the receiver, it is a measure of resistance to intermodulation.

A-006-03-11 (4) Normally, front-end selectivity is provided by the resonant networks both before and after the RF stage in a superheterodyne receiver. This whole section of the receiver is often referred to as the:
1. preamble
2. preamplifier
3. pass-selector
4. preselector
> A preselector is a tuned stage which passes a desired range of signals to a receiver:  it ensures a certain preliminary selection.  It may or may not be amplified;  in other words, active or passive.

A-006-04-01 (2) What audio shaping network is added at an FM receiver to restore proportionally attenuated lower audio frequencies?
1. A pre-emphasis network
2. A de-emphasis network
3. An audio prescaler
4. A heterodyne suppressor
> With "true" FM, deviation is independent of modulating frequency, actual deviation is determined solely by the modulating amplitude.  With Phase Modulation, deviation depends on the amount of phase shift and its rapidity, increasing modulating frequency results in proportionally more deviation even if amplitude is held constant.  Because commercial standards were based on Phase Modulation, an FM transmitter requires an artificial boost in high frequency response so that PM and FM sound the same at the receiver.  A pre-emphasis network tailors the frequency response in the FM transmitter.  De-emphasis is employed in the receiver to restore a flat audio response.

A-006-04-02 (4) What does a product detector do?
1. It provides local oscillations for input to a mixer
2. It amplifies and narrows band-pass frequencies
3. It detects cross-modulation products
4. It mixes an incoming signal with a locally generated carrier
> The Beat Frequency Oscillator feeds the Product Detector for CW and SSB detection.  Mixing the Intermediate Frequency with the BFO signal in the Product Detector produces an audio output.  In Single Sideband, it is said to "reinsert the carrier" as it recreates a reference at the exact frequency at which the carrier, suppressed at the transmitter, would have appeared out of the Intermediate Frequency chain.

1. reduces the receiver gain
2. increases the receiver gain
3. distorts the signal
4. introduces limiting
> The AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit reduces receiver gain as signal strength increases.  AGC can be "IF-derived", some say "RF-Derived" (a slight misnomer), by sampling the output of the last Intermediate Frequency stage or "AF-derived" by sampling the output of the detector.

4. It provides coupling between the beat-frequency oscillator and the detector
> A transformer provides isolation or coupling.  The only two stages that are adjacent in the choices listed are the Beat Frequency Oscillator (BFO) and the Product Detector.  A simple beat frequency oscillator can be built with a transformer normally meant for Intermediate Frequency usage:  one winding provides resonance for the oscillator, the other side couples energy to the Product Detector.

A-006-04-11 (4) What circuit combines signals from an IF amplifier stage and a beat-frequency oscillator (BFO), to produce an audio signal?

2. Be sure the transmitter is turned off and the power source is disconnected
3. Be sure propagation conditions are unfavorable for tropospheric ducting
4. Be sure to wear tight-fitting clothes and gloves to protect your body and hands from sharp edges
> With the possibility of shorter wavelengths to reach deeper into the body or to produce resonances in smaller structures, such as the eye, be extra careful not to expose anyone to microwave radiation.  The significant gain available from physically small antennas also turn low power levels into definite risks.  Heating is one known effect of RF on body tissues, other effects are possible.

> Current penetration around an antenna depends first on frequency and then on soil conductivity and dielectric constant.  At HF frequencies over salt water, penetration ranges from 5 to 18 centimetres.  Over poor ground, penetration can exceed 10 metres.

A-007-07-04 (2) Why is a ground-mounted vertical quarter-wave antenna in reasonably open surroundings better for long distance contacts than a half-wave dipole at a quarter wavelength above ground?
1. The radiation resistance is lower
2. The vertical radiation angle is lower
3. It has an omnidirectional characteristic
4. It uses vertical polarization
> key words:  DIPOLE AT A QUARTER WAVELENGTH HEIGHT.  At heights below three eights of a wavelength, ground reflections cause horizontal dipoles to direct more energy straight up.  At a height of one half-wavelength, radiation at 90 degrees is minimized and two lobes form at 30 degrees.  In this comparison, the ground-mounted vertical undoubtedly exhibits a lower radiation angle as it cannot possibly radiate upwards.

A-007-07-05 (4) When a half-wave dipole antenna is installed one-half wavelength above ground, the:
1. radiation pattern changes to produce side lobes at 15 and 50 degrees
2. side lobe radiation is cancelled
3. radiation pattern is unaffected
4. vertical or upward radiation is cancelled
> At heights below three eights of a wavelength, ground reflections cause horizontal dipoles to direct more energy straight up.  At a height of one half-wavelength, radiation at 90 degrees is minimized and two lobes form at 30 degrees.

A-007-07-06 (2) How does antenna height affect the horizontal (azimuthal) radiation pattern of a horizontal dipole HF antenna?
1. Antenna height has no effect on the pattern
2. If the antenna is less than one-half wavelength high, reflected radio waves from the ground significantly distort the pattern
3. If the antenna is less than one-half wavelength high, radiation off the ends of the wire is eliminated
4. If the antenna is too high, the pattern becomes unpredictable
> Below one half-wavelength in antenna height, there is little point in selecting a given broadside direction:  for example, choosing a north-south orientation to favour east-west radiation will not pay significant dividends for antennas close to ground.

A-007-07-07 (2) For long distance propagation, the vertical radiation angle of the energy from the antenna should be:
1. more than 45 degrees but less than 90 degrees
2. less than 30 degrees
3. 90 degrees
4. more than 30 degrees but less than 45 degrees
> Depending on band (for example, 10, 15 and 20 metre) and distance, preferred radiation angles range from 1 to 25 degrees for long distance communication.  A low radiation angle permits hitting the ionosphere at a greater distance for longer skip distances.

A-007-07-08 (2) Greater distance can be covered with multiple-hop transmissions by decreasing the:
1. power applied to the antenna
2. vertical radiation angle of the antenna
3. main height of the antenna
4. length of the antenna
> Depending on band (for example, 10, 15 and 20 metre) and distance, preferred radiation angles range from 1 to 25 degrees for long distance communication.  A low radiation angle permits hitting the ionosphere at a greater distance for longer skip distances.

A-007-07-09 (1) The impedance at the centre of a dipole antenna more than 3 wavelengths above ground would be nearest to:
1.   75 ohms
2.   25 ohms
3.   300 ohms
4.   600 ohms
> The impedance of a dipole in free space is known as 73 ohms.  Below a height of a half-wavelength, impedance is greatly affected by ground proximity.  At one wavelength and up, impedance begins to track the free-space value more closely.

A-007-07-10 (2) What is the main reason why so many VHF base and mobile antennas are 5/8 of a wavelength?
1. The angle of radiation is high giving excellent local coverage
2. Most of the energy is radiated at a low angle
3. It's easy to match the antenna to the transmitter
4. It's a convenient length on VHF
> The 'five eights' wavelength antenna focuses energy somewhat better towards the horizon (lower radiation angle) than a regular quarter-wave antenna.

A-007-07-11 (1) The most important consideration when deciding upon an antenna for contacting stations at great distances (DX) is:
1. vertical angle of radiation
2. sunspot activity
3. impedance
4. bandwidth

1. Aliasing amplifier
2. Analog to digital converter
3. Digital to analog converter
4. Mathematical transform
> Digital Signal Processing first transforms an analog signal to digital via an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), performs mathematical operations to filter or demodulate, for example, and recreates an analog signal through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).  Aliasing is a situation where input frequencies above the sampling rate get erroneously reproduced as lower frequencies;  the situation is prevented through the use of an anti-aliasing filter (a low-pass filter).

In digital terms, Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Dynamic Range are synonyms specifying the ratio between the largest possible sample value to the quantization error.
